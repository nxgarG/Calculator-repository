the calculator will not be a simple one
it will have a gui based on tkinter

should except -
1. basic integers (from 0 to 9)
2. floats (x.x)
3. no variables
4. basic separators like brackets
5. basic constants like pie, planks constant, Rydberg's constant, mass of fundamental particles and
   similar stuff

should do -
1. basic calculations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
2. bit advanced stuff like square, square root, cube, its root
3. infact it should be able to do any number raised to any number
4. should have a delete last button press function

should also have a history tab
should also be able to change the location of the cursor in the expression

design -
1. first tab should have the basic function
2. second tab should have advanced functions

first design the working
then the ui
